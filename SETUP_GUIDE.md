   ```

#### 1.5 Get API Credentials

1. Click **Settings** (gear icon in sidebar)

3. Copy these values (you'll need them soon):
   - **Project URL** (e.g., `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`)

### Part 2: Local Development Setup (10 minutes)

#### 2.1 Install Dependencies

Open your terminal in the project directory:

```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm install
```

This will install:
- React and React DOM
- Supabase client
- React Query
- TailwindCSS
- Tesseract.js (OCR)
- React Router
- Lucide icons
- And all other dependencies

#### 2.2 Configure Environment Variables

3. Replace the placeholder values with your Supabase credentials:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
   VITE_EXCHANGE_API_KEY=

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Missing Supabase environment variables"

**Solution**: Make sure your `.env` file exists and has the correct values. Restart the dev server after creating/updating `.env`.

### Issue: OCR not extracting data

**Solution**: 
- Ensure the image is clear and well-lit
- Try a different image format (PNG, JPG)
- Manual entry is always available as fallback

### Issue: "Row Level Security policy violation"

**Solution**: 
- Make sure you ran `infra/rls_policies.sql`
- Check that you're logged in
- Verify your user has the correct role

### Issue: File upload fails

**Solution**:
- Check that the `receipts` bucket exists in Supabase Storage
- Verify storage policies are set up correctly
- Check file size (max 10MB)

### Issue: Currency conversion not working

**Solution**:
- Check internet connection
- The free API has rate limits
- The app will still work, just won't convert currencies

## Next Steps

Now that your app is set up:

1. **Customize**: Update colors in `tailwind.config.js`
2. **Add Categories**: Modify `EXPENSE_CATEGORIES` in `src/lib/constants.js`
3. **Configure Rules**: Create different approval rules for different scenarios
4. **Add More Users**: Build out your team
5. **Test Workflows**: Try different approval scenarios

## Support

If you run into issues:

1. Check the main README.md
2. Review Supabase documentation
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify all SQL scripts ran successfully
